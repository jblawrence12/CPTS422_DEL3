for the halstead metrics I checked the https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-halsteads-software-metrics/ website and did my best to follow the metric formulas for the halstead metrics that were to be tested, whicher were difficulty, effort, length, vocab and volume. To my knowledge the code was working accurately.
